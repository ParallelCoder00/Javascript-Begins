console.log(2 < 3)

// These will give answers in true or false which is obvious

console.log(null < 4)
console.log(null > 4)
console.log(null != 4)
console.log(null <= 4)
console.log(null >= 4)
console.log(null == 4)

// These are different the == operator works differently, the other operators will automatically convert the null into 0 to compare them so the answer will come in true and false, they dont give NaN output

//These type of confusing code should not be written and avoid writing such code
